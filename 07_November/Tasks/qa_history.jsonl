{"timestamp": "2025-11-07T05:42:21.065346", "query": "Explain fast api", "response": " FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and highly performant, leveraging the capabilities of Python's asyncio for asynchronous programming.\n\nHere are some key features of FastAPI:\n\n1. **High Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks available, thanks to its use of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts. It can handle thousands of requests per second.\n\n2. **Automatic Documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc. This makes it easy to test and understand your API.\n\n3. **Type Hints**: FastAPI uses Python's type hints to validate request and response data, which helps catch errors early and improves code readability.\n\n4. **Asynchronous Support**: FastAPI supports asynchronous programming out of the box, allowing you to write non-blocking code and handle concurrent requests efficiently.\n\n5. **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI has a robust dependency injection system that makes it easy to manage and reuse code across different parts of your application.\n\n6. **Data Validation**: With Pydantic, FastAPI provides powerful data validation and serialization,"}
