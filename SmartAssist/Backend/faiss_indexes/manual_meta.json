[{"text": "Task: Build & Judge a Mini AI Part 1 Chronology of AI Write one real-world example for each stage: Machine Learning E-Commerce Recommendation Engine recommending products based on past purchase behavior, interests and other similar purchases. Deep Learning Self-driving cars using neural network to process visuals to identify roads, pedestrians, traffic signals and using GPS data to plan the routes Computer Vision In Agriculture, computer vision is used to identify crop health,soil condition and diseases NLP Using Google to translate sentences in different languages uses NLP or Using Alexa for asking weather information LLMs LLMs are used to generate content ideas and automate the content creation as well as for coding e.g Github copilot which suggest next lines based on previous code context Part 2 Deep Learning Architectures Match the model to the use case: 1. RNN 2. LSTM 3. CNN 4. Transformer Use cases: Image recognition -> 3. CNN Text translation (old Google Translate) -> 2. LSTM Predicting the next word in ChatGPT -> 4. Transformer Early speech-to-text systems -> 1. RNN Part 3 Frameworks Choose one framework (PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras). In one sentence , explain why you would use it if you were a student making a cat-vs-dog classifier. Ans : Cat vs Dog classification is a simple binary classification task for which I will use Keras as it comes with pre-built models and is easy to use. Part 4 Evaluation Metrics Imagine you built a spam filter. Answer: Precision: If it marks 10 emails as spam and 7 are truly spam what s Precision? Ans : 0.7 Recall: If there were 12 spam emails in total, how many did it catch? (use same example) Ans : 0.58 F1 Score: Use the formula and calculate (round to 2 decimals). Ans : 0.63 MSE/MAE: Predict your friend"}, {"text": "spam and 7 are truly spam what s Precision? Ans : 0.7 Recall: If there were 12 spam emails in total, how many did it catch? (use same example) Ans : 0.58 F1 Score: Use the formula and calculate (round to 2 decimals). Ans : 0.63 MSE/MAE: Predict your friend s age (actual = 15, prediction = 18). Which metric punishes the error more? Ans : MSE BLEU/ROUGE: AI translated The cat sat on the mat as Cat is on the mat. Which metric (BLEU/ROUGE) do you think would give a high score? Ans : ROUGE Part 5 Responsible AI & Explainability You built an AI that predicts loan approvals. A customer asks, Why was my loan rejected? Write one simple way to explain the decision fairly (e.g., Your income was too low compared to the loan size ). Ans : Based on your installment history of past loans, you have missed multiple EMIs due to which your credit score got a hit and hence the loan was rejected. Deliverable: Each trainee should write answers in 5 7 short lines."}]
